# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive website with dynamic tables that enable users to filter UFO sightings by multiple criteria at the same time, such as date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO sighting.

# Results:

## Outcome of Analysis
To perform a search on the interactive website, the existing search button was replaced with code that enabled the website to automatically update the results of the table once an input was provided in any of the 5 filters (date, city, state, country, or shape).
We did this by removing the list element that created the button.  Below, please find images that show the resulting website after refactoring the code.

# Summary:

## Drawbacks
One drawback of this website is that the search boxes require exact-matching text.  If the user types a metric incorrectly (i.e. Covingtn instead of Covington), the output may not be what they are looking for! 

## Future Development
This webpage can be further developed by making the search boxes more dynamic.  Instead of exact match, there could be a more “lenient” match (though I would need to do some research on how this could be performed).  

Additionally, we should write code to make adjustments to the UFO database to make the data more uniform and professional looking.  Afterall, we want users to take our UFO sightings seriously! In order to do this, we should apply the correct formatting to city, state, country, etc. For instance, “benton” and “ar” should read “Benton” and “AR”.
